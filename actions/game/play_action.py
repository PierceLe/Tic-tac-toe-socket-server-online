PlayAction Module

This module defines the PlayAction class and supporting functions to handle the process of
a player making a move in a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It checks room membership, validates moves,
updates game status, and manages the end-of-game responses.

Classes:
    PlayAction: Represents the action of a player placing a marker on the board.

Functions:
    check_join_room: Verifies if a player is in an active room.
    check_all_characters_not_zero: Checks if all positions on the board are filled.
    check_status: Determines if there is a winner based on the board status.
    handle_response_game_end: Manages end-of-game responses, sending messages to players
                              and viewers, and cleaning up the room.
    play_game: Executes the playerâ€™s move, updates the board, and checks game state.
